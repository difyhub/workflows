## What is DifyHub?

DifyHub is an open-source community and platform for Dify workflows. This repository stores all the DSL files and metadata for the workflows showcased on [DifyHub.com](https://difyhub.com) (coming soon!).

Our goal is to create a central hub where anyone can find high-quality, battle-tested workflows to supercharge their Dify applications, saving you hours of building from scratch.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Browse** the `/workflows` directory to find a workflow you need.
2.  **Open** the `workflow.dsl` file.
3.  **Copy** the raw JSON/YAML content and import it into your Dify application.
4.  **(Coming Soon)** Browse, search, and preview all workflows visually on [DifyHub.com](https://difyhub.com)!
