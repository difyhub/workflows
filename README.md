## What is DifyHub?

DifyHub is an open-source community and platform for Dify workflows. This repository stores all the DSL files and metadata for the workflows showcased on [DifyHub.com](https://difyhub.com).

Our goal is to create a central hub where anyone can find high-quality, battle-tested workflows to supercharge their Dify applications, saving you hours of building from scratch.

## 🚀 How to Use

We are building a platform at [DifyHub.com](https://difyhub.com) (coming soon!) that provides:

* **🔍 Powerful Search & Filtering**
* **✨ Visual Workflow Previews**
* **🚀 One-Click Deployment (PRO)**

In the meantime, you can use this repository directly:

1.  **Browse** the `/workflows` directory to find a workflow you need (e.g., `rag/basic-rag`).
2.  **Open** the `workflow.dsl` file.
3.  **Copy** the raw JSON/YAML content.
4.  **Paste** it into your Dify application by importing it.

## 💡 How to Contribute (We Need You!)

We welcome all contributions! If you have built a useful Dify workflow, please share it with the community.

**Contributing is simple:**

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Create a new folder** under the `/workflows` directory. Choose a clear category and name, for example: `social-media/ai-tweet-generator`.
3.  **Add your files** to this new folder:
    * `workflow.dsl`: The exported DSL file from Dify.
    * `README.md`: A description of what your workflow does, how to use it, and any API keys needed. (We will provide a template soon).
4.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** to our `main` branch.

Our team will review your PR, and once merged, it will automatically be synced to [DifyHub.com](https://difyhub.com) and credited to you.
